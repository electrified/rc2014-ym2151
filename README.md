## History
The YM2151 tone generator and accompanying YM3012 stereo DAC have been used in several computer systems.
Most notably the Sharp X68000 and Yamaha's CX5M MSX computer, along with a number of arcade boards.
More recently the retro inspired Commander X16 also has one.

Yamaha's DX21, DX27 and DX100 synthesisers used a derivative IC which is very similar.
